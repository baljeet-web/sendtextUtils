This is a project built to help everyone at any age group to make their daily work easier on laptops.

This project contains few functions like -

1..Convert to Upper Case- This will help the users to get all the text in Upper Case. Also, this can be used to make kids learn about upper case and lower case.

2..Convert to Lower Case- This will help the users to get all the text in Lower Case. Also, this can be used to make kids learn about upper case and lower case.

3..Copy Text- People can use this to first write anything, then confirm if they have written this correctly, and then finally copy and paste it anywhere.

4..Remove Extra Spaces- This is the most used function, where you can put a long text and just by a simple click, you can remove any extra spaces possible.

After this, we also have some features, where we can count the number of words and characters in the text.
